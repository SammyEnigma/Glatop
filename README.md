### What is a "shell"
The OS UI provides users with access to a wide variety of objects necessary for running applications and managing the operating system.
In the standard Windows environment, for instance, all these functions are provided by Explorer, which provides the Start Menu, Taskbar and System Tray, amongst other things.


## Supported OS

Glatop currently supports all versions of Windows 7, 8, and 10. Users can easily run Glatop without any risk to the current desktop environment. If user kill Glatop process he will see standart windows Desktop.

## Features

  - Looks like standart desktop (Can't be minimized, always on bottom, default icons)
  - Free locations of items (non grid, like OS X Desktop)
  - Top-level folders become a desktop extension (GLA screens). You can group same files into that GLA screens and access them without opening a separate Explorer window
